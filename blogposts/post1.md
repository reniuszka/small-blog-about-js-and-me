### I am reading JS series written by Kyles Simpson - You Don't Know JS

#### Decided to make short notes what is important to know about JS and its rules and facts

##### One rule: to keep me motivated want to write down 5 important info about JS

1. The core language of JavaScript is standardized by the ECMA TC39 committee as a language named ECMAScript

2. TC39 means Technical Committee number 39. TC 39 works on maintaining and updating the standard for the ECMAScript programming language There are 50-100 members of TC39, from different big companies (Mozilla, Google, Apple, Samsung...). Usually they meet up once per 2 months for up to 3 days

3. Don't use JS6 or ES8. You should use "ES20xx" ex: ES2019

4. JS works on the Web or in Node.js environment

5. JavaScript is backwards-compatible. This means that once something is accepted as valid JS, there will not be a future change to the language that causes that code to become invalid JS. JS code written in 1995 - however primitive or limited - should still work now.
